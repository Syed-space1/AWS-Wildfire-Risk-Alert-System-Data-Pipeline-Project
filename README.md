# AWS-Wildfire-Risk-Alert-System-Data-Pipeline-Project
Built an AWS serverless data pipeline utilizing Tomorrow.io API, Lambda, DynamoDB, and Event Scheduler to analyze real-time weather data for wildfire risk. Implemented EventBridge for event-driven data processing and SNS for automated alerts when wildfire risk reaches 'High' or 'Very High'. Optimized performance with a cost-effective, scalable architecture for real-time risk assessment
